                <h2>Volunteering</h2>
                <p>
                    In Spring 2019, we launched the UPenn Chess Initiative for Talented Youth (UPCITY), which is a
                    program to offer chess education and improvement opportunities to talented youth in the Philadelphia
                    community. Every Thursday on our campus from 6 to 7:30 in the evenings, we host workshops for
                    players of all levels and age groups who show interest and promise to improve their game by working
                    with some of the finest players in the region.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, we have developed partnerships with the Free Library of Philadelphia in conjunction
                    with ASAP to provide after-school instruction to students at the Walnut Street West Library on
                    Wednesdays 5:45-7.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Volunteering and inspiring the next generation of chess students, from beginner to more advanced, is
                    an incredibly rewarding experience, and we encourage anyone who has interest in chess to at least
                    try to come to one volunteering session. There are students of all levels, so there will definitely
                    be ways to contribute no matter your skill level!
                </p>
                <p>
