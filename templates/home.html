                    “The beauty of chess is it can be whatever you want it to be. It transcends language, age,
                    race,
                    religion, politics, gender, and socioeconomic background. Whatever your circumstances,
                    anyone
                    can enjoy a good fight to the death over the chess board.”

                    UPenn Chess Club invites you to our community! Here you will find all kinds of people,
                    ranging
                    from the quantitative trader to the dedicated volunteer at West Philly. Ultimately, we all
                    love
                    this fun and intellectual game, and we wish to share it with the rest of the community.
